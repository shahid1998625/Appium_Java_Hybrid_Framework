I am writing to formally request leave from July 6th to July 7th, totaling 2 days.  \n \n   The reason for this leave is a planned family vacation. I have ensured that all my current tasks are up-to-date, and I am happy to assist in any way to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence. \n \n  In my absence, Alekhya/Kishore has agreed to cover my responsibilities. I will also be available via email or phone for any urgent matters that may require my attention. \n \n  Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding and support.
